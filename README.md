# CTA-EL-Station-Tracker
A really simple bit of python code using the CTA API to write some stuff to the console. 
It was my first time using APIs in python, as well as the first time I've used python, so the code isn't the most well optimized or formatted.
The project was helped along by some tutorials on APIs, as well as user kpphillips. I'll link his project here as well:
https://github.com/kpphillips/Pythonista-Projects/tree/master/CTA%20Bus%20Tracker%20API

For a first time API user, this was a lot of fun. I decided to use python, mostly because I hadn't used it in forever. However, this was a fun
project to learn about how the API worked. In the future, I do want to link this up with a physical sign in my room, and maybe see if I can hook
it into a custom discord bot? (I already have one, you can find it on my github... I think.) For a project that only took me a few hours in between classes,
I'm quite proud of it. I will probably end up working on it in the future, and I have a few plans I hope to implement. Maybe someday I'll make it a website or
something. 

You will need your own CTA API key to use this, and you will have to insert it into the code, as well as having an IDE to compile the code.
